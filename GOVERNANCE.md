# Governance and Legal

This document defines the governance model and legal posture for DEX (DataEngineX).

## Legal Structure

DEX is currently maintained as an open-source project under maintainer stewardship.

- Current model: maintainer-led open-source project
- Future option: migrate to a formal legal entity (foundation/non-profit/company-backed OSS) if scale or compliance requires it

## Open-Source License

DEX is licensed under the OSI-approved MIT License.

- License file: `LICENSE`
- SPDX identifier: `MIT`

## Governance Model

### Roles

- **Owner/Maintainer**: final decisions on roadmap, releases, and governance
- **Contributors**: submit issues, discussions, pull requests, and documentation updates
- **Reviewers**: maintainers or trusted contributors with review permissions

### Decision Process

1. Open an Issue or Discussion
2. Propose scope and trade-offs
3. Collect feedback from maintainers/community
4. Merge via pull request with documented rationale

For major changes (architecture, security, release process), prefer ADR updates under `docs/adr/`.

## Community Standards

- Contributor guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Code of Conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Security reporting: `SECURITY.md`
- Support channels: `SUPPORT.md`

## Project Identity and Trademark

Code is open under MIT, but branding and project identity are protected by policy.

- Trademark policy: `TRADEMARK_POLICY.md`

## Governance Evolution

If DEX grows substantially, maintainers may adopt:

- A steering group or maintainer council
- A published release governance cadence
- A formal legal entity for funding, contracting, and trademark administration

Changes to governance should be proposed by PR against this file.
