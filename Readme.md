## 🚀 Project Overview

DEX aims to demonstrate the **full lifecycle of Python-based data projects**:

1. **Data Collection & Engineering** – Acquire, clean, transform, and store data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization** – Analyze datasets and extract insights.  
3. **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** – Build classical ML models, neural networks, and LLM pipelines.  
4. **Pipelines & Workflow Automation** – Python-based ETL, ML, and AI workflows.  
5. **MLOps** – Experiment tracking, model versioning, CI/CD, and automated retraining.  
6. **DevOps & Deployment** – Containerized APIs, cloud-ready services, monitoring, and logging.  
7. **Experimentation & Documentation** – Reproducible notebooks, reports, and dashboards for all phases.

DEX is **extensible**, allowing integration of new datasets, models, and AI technologies as learning progresses.
