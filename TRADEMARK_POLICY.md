# DataEngineX Trademark and Brand Policy

This policy explains how people may use the DataEngineX name and branding.

## Purpose

DEX is open source and free to use under the project license. At the same time, the project name and identity should not be misrepresented.

## Code vs Brand

- **Code license** (see `LICENSE`) governs use, modification, and distribution of source code.
- **Trademark/brand policy** governs use of names, logos, and project identity.

Open source access to code does **not** automatically grant permission to use project branding in a way that implies official origin, endorsement, or ownership.

## Allowed Without Permission

- Saying your project is “built with DataEngineX (DEX)”.
- Linking to this repository and citing it in documentation.
- Creating forks for learning, experimentation, and contribution.
- Referring to compatibility (for example: “compatible with DEX APIs”).

## Not Allowed Without Permission

- Publishing a modified fork using the names “DataEngineX” or “DEX” as the primary project name.
- Using project logos/branding in a way that suggests your fork is the official project.
- Releasing packages, Docker images, or products that could reasonably be confused with official DEX releases.
- Claiming authorship/ownership of the original DataEngineX project.

## Official Package and Image Names

To reduce impersonation risk, treat these names as official upstream identifiers:

- **PyPI package (official):** `dataenginex`
- **GHCR image namespace (official):** `ghcr.io/thedataenginex/dex`

If you publish a fork, use distinct names that avoid confusion.

Examples:

- **Allowed (fork):** `myenginex` (PyPI), `ghcr.io/<your-org>/myenginex`
- **Not allowed (fork):** `dataenginex-official`, `ghcr.io/<your-org>/dex`

## Fork Naming Guidance

If you redistribute a fork publicly:

- Use a **distinct project name**.
- Keep visible attribution to DataEngineX and original authors.
- Clearly state that your fork is unofficial.

Example: “MyEngine (forked from DataEngineX)”.

## Attribution Expectations

- Preserve copyright and license notices.
- Keep references to upstream project origin in derivative distributions.
- Include a clear changelog section for fork-specific modifications.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may request changes to names, logos, package names, or marketing text that violate this policy.

## Questions and Permission Requests

Open a Discussion or Issue in this repository to request permission for trademark use or to clarify edge cases.
