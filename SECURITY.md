# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep DataEngineX (DEX) secure.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are prioritized for:

- Current development branch: `dev`
- Latest stable release on `main`

Older versions may receive guidance only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Use one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
2. Private maintainer contact via repository Discussions request for security triage

If needed, open a minimal public issue without exploit details and ask maintainers for a private channel.

## What to Include

- Affected component/path
- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Response Expectations

Maintainers aim to:

- Acknowledge report within 72 hours
- Share triage status and severity
- Provide fix/mitigation timeline when reproducible

## Disclosure

Please allow maintainers time to validate and patch before public disclosure.
Coordinated disclosure helps protect users.

## Scope Notes

- Security reports should focus on code and configuration in this repository.
- Third-party service outages/cost issues are not security vulnerabilities by themselves.
